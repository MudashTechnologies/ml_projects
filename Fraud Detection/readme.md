# Mobile Price Classification Using Machine Learning üß†
Mobile price classification is a type of machine learning problem which encounters an input features that contain the characteristics of a mobile such as processor speed, clock speed, screen, size, installed memory, storage size, etc. The purpose of this project is to make an automated machine learning model that could automatically classify the price range of a mobile with respect to its features.

## Requirements üìù
- Python 3.6 or above
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn

## Code and Resources Used üßë‚Äçüíª
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.9
- **Packages:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow & Keras
- **Optimization Approaches:** Cross Entropy, Classification Accuracy
- **Loss Functions:** Log Loss

## Methodology üõ†Ô∏è
For making a machine learning model a mobile price classification data set was used to contain mobile prices of over 2000 mobiles the testing data was explicitly provided for this classification problem and the trend model after training on training data set was tested on the unseen data set outstanding accuracies of **95%+** was achieved by using classifiers such as **SVM**, **Naive Bayes Classifier**, **Random Forest Classifier** and **Logistical Regression** algorithm. For this problem, tabular daatset was employed in the form of a csv file.
