# Machine Learning Projcets
This is the repository that contains all projects related to machine learning, data science, deep learning, artificial intelligence, developed by AI &amp; ML Engineers working at Mudash Technologies. This repo contains:
- End-to-end machine learning projects with documentation & code
- Interactive Visualizations of dataset features used in making machine learning models
- Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Selection, Optimization & Predictions
- All types of machine learning projects, such as classification, regression, clustering, time series forecasting, PCA, neural networks, and more

## About the Code
- The code for machine learning projects are written in Jupyter Notebooks using Python
- For making projects, following libraries of python are used:
  - NumPy 
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seabhorn

## <a href="https://github.com/MudashTechnologies/ml_projects/tree/main/CKD%20Using%20Machine%20Learning">Project A: Chronic Kidney Disease Detection Using ML</a>
- Created an end-to-end machine learning project that uses machine learning classifiers such as SVM, Decision Trees & Random Forests, and deep learning models like feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) to make an acccurate predictive model for esrly detection of CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease)
- Optimized the performance of ML classifiers and performed cross validatation to find the best-performing model in both cases of machine & deep learning
- Attained an accuray of 98% using random forest and 97% using FFNNs

## <a href="https://github.com/MudashTechnologies/ml_projects/tree/main/CKD%20Using%20Machine%20Learning">Project B: ECG Arrhythmia Classification Using Deep Learning</a>
- Created an end-to-end machine learning project that uses deep learning classifiers such as Concolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) & Long-Short-Term-Mmeory (LSTM) Network for classifying ECG beats in 5 classes
- Optimized the performance of deep classifiers and performed cross validatation to find the best-performing model in both cases of CNN & LSTM
- Attained an overall accuracy of 98% on both cases
