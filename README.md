# Machine Learning Projcets
This is the repository that contains all projects related to machine learning, data science, deep learning, artificial intelligence, developed by AI &amp; ML Engineers working at Mudash Technologies. This repo contains:
- End-to-end machine learning projects with documentation & code
- Interactive Visualizations of dataset features used in making machine learning models
- Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Selection, Optimization & Predictions
- All types of machine learning projects, such as classification, regression, clustering, time series forecasting, PCA, neural networks, and more

## About the Code
- The code for machine learning projects are written in Jupyter Notebooks using Python
- For making projects, following libraries of python are used:
  - NumPy 
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seabhorn
